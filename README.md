# orchestrator

Run several Claude Code sessions over one repository, from a single window — and
see at a glance which ones are working, which are waiting on you, and which of
your PRs have review threads to answer.

Each session lives in its own git worktree with its own terminal. The daemon owns
every process, so closing the window kills nothing you did not mean to and losing
the browser tab loses nothing at all. Beside the sessions it polls your open PRs,
lists the reviews waiting on you, and drives a review-resolve flow that drafts
replies you approve before anything is posted.

## What it is

A Rust daemon plus a small vanilla-JS web app, shipped as one desktop application
(the daemon runs in-process behind a webview) and also runnable headless in a
browser tab. It hosts [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)
sessions; it is not itself an agent.

The pieces:

- **A pty host.** Every session and managed process runs in a daemon-owned pty
  with a replayable scrollback buffer. The web UI is a disposable view of it —
  close it, reopen it, attach from a second window; nothing restarts.
- **A session board.** Spawn a session in the main checkout or in a fresh
  worktree. A state machine (driven by Claude Code's hooks) shows each as
  working, waiting on you, or done, with the build status of any process beside
  it folded in.
- **A PR pane.** Your open PRs, polled from GitHub, with review-thread counts and
  a one-click resolve flow.
- **A review queue.** Optionally, the PRs where your review is requested, ranked
  by a command you configure.
- **A diff viewer** against the merge-base, with an editable pane that warns the
  agent when you have changed a file under it.
- **A CLI.** `orch` drives a running daemon from your shell, and from inside a
  session, so an agent can open a helper session for a subtask, or ask you a
  question and block until you answer. [Install](#install) lists what it does.

## What you need

| What | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** (`claude` on `PATH`, signed in) | The daemon spawns it for every session. Without it a session exits the instant it starts, so the daemon says so at boot rather than letting you find out that way. |
| **git** | Worktrees, branch moves, diffs — all of it. |
| **WebKitGTK 4.1** (Linux only) | The desktop window. Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian 12 or newer; 20.04 ships 4.0 and will not work. macOS uses the system WebView. |
| **`gh`**, signed in | Reads go out with `curl`, and for those `github_token_file` replaces it. Every write (a thread reply, a 👍, a re-requested review) shells `gh` and uses its credential, so the resolve flow wants it. |
| **node** | Only for the review queue that ships with it — the ejected `reviews.js` is a node script. Point `reviews_command` at anything you like, or clear it, and node stops mattering. |

A fresh checkout also needs Claude Code's **workspace trust**, accepted once in
its dialog. Until then sessions die on spawn.

Nothing here is checked at install time. The daemon checks at **boot**, names what
is missing and what stops working, and starts anyway.

## Install

A release attaches an installer per platform and a tarball beside it. The
installers are the shortest path: a `.deb` or the `.dmg` gives you an app in your
launcher, with an icon, and puts `orch` where the shell can find it. The tarball
is what `mise` reads, and is still two binaries you place yourself.

- **`orchestrator-desktop`** is the app. The daemon and the web UI are compiled
  into it, so this one binary on its own is a complete install.
- **`orch` is optional.** `orch new` starts another session with a prompt,
  `orch kill` undoes one of its own spawns, `orch teardown` removes a clean worktree
  through the same checks as the button, `orch ask` puts a question in front of
  you and blocks until you answer, `orch ls` lists what is running.
  `orch new --worktree` gives a helper session its own tree and branch, which is the
  difference between two parallel jobs and two agents sharing one git index.
  `orch <command> --help` documents the flags. Nothing requires it.
  Every session is told it is there: the daemon hands each spawn a vendored
  `orch` skill, so an agent reaches for the CLI without being told to in a prompt.

Apple Silicon and x86-64 Linux are built.

### From an installer

```
sudo apt install ./Orchestrator_<version>_amd64.deb   # Debian/Ubuntu
```

Puts the app at `/usr/bin/orchestrator-desktop`, `orch` on your `PATH`, and a
launcher entry with its icon. `apt remove orchestrator` takes all of it away.

The **AppImage** is the same app for everything that is not Debian: `chmod +x`
and run it. It carries its own GTK/WebKit, so it is an order of magnitude
larger than the deb, and `orch` rides inside it: the daemon puts its own directory
on each session's `PATH`, so an agent can still reach it.

On **macOS**, open the `.dmg` and drag the app to Applications. It is unsigned, so
the first launch is right-click → Open rather than a double-click.

### Through mise (with the `github` backend)

```
mise use -g "github:kbarendrecht/orchestrator"
mise up          # upgrade to the newest release later
```

mise picks the right asset for your platform, verifies its checksum and release
provenance, and extracts **both** binaries — so `orch` lands beside
`orchestrator-desktop` and no second entry is needed. (The older `ubi:` backend
still resolves these releases, but mise has deprecated it.)

Installed this way, **the app upgrades itself**: the release nudge carries an
Upgrade button that runs `mise upgrade` for you, then a Restart button, because the
new build is installed beside the running one and a restart is what picks it up.
Every other install keeps the link to the release instead — a `.deb` belongs to
apt, and an AppImage or a `.dmg` is a file you downloaded.

### From a release tarball

```
tar -xzf orchestrator-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz   # → orchestrator-desktop, orch
# macOS: the binaries are unsigned, so clear the download quarantine first
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine orchestrator-desktop orch
```

Put them on your `PATH` (`orch` only if you want it) and run
`orchestrator-desktop`.

A tarball or a mise install carries no launcher entry, because there is no
installer to write one. **The app writes its own on first launch**: a `.desktop`
file under `~/.local/share/applications` on Linux, and an
`~/Applications/Orchestrator.app` on macOS, which is what puts it in Finder,
Spotlight and Launchpad. Force it, or write it again after moving the binary, with:

```
orchestrator-desktop --install-desktop-entry
```

It points at the binary that ran it and uses the same id the packages do, so
installing a `.deb` or the `.dmg` later replaces the entry instead of listing the
app twice. Two things it will not do: write anything for an install that carries
its own entry (the `.deb`, the AppImage, the `.dmg`), and write anything from a
build tree, where the shared id would let `cargo run` shadow a real install.

Because a mise install lives at a version-pinned path, the entry names the
`latest` symlink beside it where there is one, and is rewritten at the next launch
when the binary has moved. A bundle built this way is also unquarantined, so it
opens on a plain double-click, unlike the unsigned `.dmg`.

**Linux** needs **WebKitGTK 4.1** at runtime (Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian 12 or newer;
20.04 ships only 4.0 and will not work). **macOS** uses the system WebView and
needs nothing extra.

**After a mise or tarball install, run `orchestrator-desktop` once from a
terminal.** That first launch writes the launcher entry: a Finder and Spotlight
entry on macOS, an application-menu entry on Linux. From then on you can start it
the way you start anything else, and an upgrade keeps the entry pointing at the
build you are running.

Then launch it and point it at a git checkout when it asks (it shows a folder
picker when it has no config, or when the one on record has moved). That checkout
is *main*; worktrees are cut inside it under `.claude/worktrees/`. State lives in
`~/.config/orchd/` on Linux and `~/Library/Application Support/orchd/` on macOS —
move it with `ORCHD_CONFIG_DIR`.

## Configuring it for your repo

The defaults ask nothing of the repo you point at: no review-queue command, no
managed processes, no tracker. You get the session board, PR pane, diff viewer and
worktrees on a bare `{ "main_checkout": "…" }`, and you turn the rest on as your
repo can support it. Everything here is editable in the settings panel and written
back to `config.json`; changes take effect on restart.

| Setting | Default | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `upstream_ref` / `upstream_remote` | `origin/HEAD`, `origin` | the base every diff and worktree is measured against. On a **fork workflow** — an `upstream` remote beside `origin` — a first run detects it and writes `upstream/<default branch>` instead, so there is nothing to set by hand. |
| `reviews_command` | the ejected `reviews.js` | argv printing the review queue as JSON. See below. Empty means the pane reads "not configured" rather than "unavailable". |
| `main_processes` | *(empty)* | long-running processes shown in the drawer. See below. |
| `tracker` | `none` | where an out-of-scope review point can be filed as a story. Three fields — `mcp_server`, `host` and an optional `token_env` — so pointing it at another tracker is a config edit rather than a release. Its token is **not** a config key — set `ORCHD_TRACKER_TOKEN` in the daemon's environment, or let `env_source` read the checkout's own. It also needs the repo to declare a matching **MCP server** — see below. |
| `env_source` | `mise` | which tool is asked what a session's own directory exports — `mise`, `direnv`, or `none`. Config file only, not in the settings panel. See below. |
| `default_language` | `English` | the language the agent *writes* replies and stories in. Prompts and code stay English regardless. |
| `shared_worktree_paths` | *(empty)* | directories inside a worktree that are allowed to be symlinks *out* of it, e.g. a plan dir shared back to main. The editable diff pane refuses every other path that resolves outside the workspace. |
| `worktree_init` / `worktree_setup` | *(empty)* | two commands run in every worktree the daemon cuts itself. See below. |
| `worktree_retention_days` | `60` | remove the worktree of a conversation not worked in for this many days, hourly, and one that no conversation points at at all. Age is the transcript's last write, not the session's start, so a conversation you kept open for weeks is not old the day after you stop; an orphaned tree is dated by its own directory. **The tree, never the row**: the session stays in the rail and a resume rebuilds the tree, so this reclaims disk rather than losing work, and it removes nothing the teardown preflight would refuse — a dirty tree, an unpushed commit, a live session or a running process all keep it. `0` turns it off. It exists because `claude --worktree` removes its own tree when its session ends and never gets to: the daemon owns the pty and kills it. |

The table above is the set most repos touch. The rest are operational, and most
repos leave them at the default:

| Setting | Default | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main_checkout` | *(required)* | the privileged checkout the daemon manages. The one key with no default; the folder picker writes it on first run. |
| `extra_checkouts` | `[]` | further checkouts to open **beside** `main_checkout`, so several repositories show at once in one rail. Each entry gets a whole `orchd` of its own — its own process, port, `config.json` and instance lock — and a colour in the rail. So per-repository settings go in *that* repository's own config file, under `<config dir>/repos/<name>-<hash>/`. Read by the app, not by the daemon. Written by `+ repository` at the foot of the rail, so it is not a key you have to know about; right-click a repository's header to fold it away or close it. |
| `worktrees_subdir` | `.claude/worktrees` | where worktrees live, relative to `main_checkout`. Point it at the same place a repo's own `WorktreeCreate` hook puts them, so the daemon recognises its own worktrees. Kept relative and inside main on purpose. |
| `port` | `7777` | the loopback port the daemon serves the SPA and API on. Never bound to anything but `127.0.0.1`. |
| `repo` | *(derived)* | `owner/name` override, when it cannot be read off the upstream remote. |
| `github_token_file` | *(none)* | a `0600` file holding a read-only GitHub token, outside the repo. An alternative to `ORCHD_GITHUB_TOKEN` or `gh auth token`. Reads only: the writes go through `gh`. |
| `worktree_processes` | *(empty)* | managed processes for worktree workspaces, the counterpart to `main_processes`. Empty means a shell is opened on demand instead. |
| `poll_seconds` | `300` | how often the PR poll runs. One query per period, negligible against the API budget. |
| `review_timeout_seconds` | `240` | ceiling for `reviews_command` before the poller gives up on it. |
| `story_timeout_seconds` | `300` | ceiling for the borrowed story-filing agent — the one timeout in the daemon, because its caller is a blocking request rather than a rail entry someone is watching. |
| `allow_several_in_main` | `false` | let main hold more than one live session. Off because one checkout is one working tree and one git index: two agents there share both, the changed-file pane merges their edits without saying who wrote what, and one agent's `git add` stages the other's work. Moving main's checkout still refuses while any session is live in it. Editable in the settings panel. |
| `auto_resume` | `true` | relaunch sessions that were live when the daemon last went down, with `--resume`, so a crash costs the scrollback rather than the conversation. |
| `forge` | `github` | which forge the repo lives on. Only GitHub is implemented; the key exists so a second platform is a config choice, not a rebuild. |
| `workspace_notes` | *(empty)* | what to tell an agent whose conversation was just moved into a workspace, keyed by the kind it landed in. The daemon states the factual half (which branch, which directory); this is the half only the repo knows. |

An **unknown key is ignored in silence** — a misspelling does not error, it just
leaves the default in force. Check the spelling against this list if a setting
seems to do nothing.

### Fork workflow, or not

Both are supported and neither needs configuring by hand.

**Not a fork** — one remote, branches pushed to it. This is the default:
`origin/HEAD` is the base, so diffs and worktrees are measured against whatever
your remote's default branch is, whether that is `main`, `master` or something
else. Nothing to set.

**A fork** — `origin` is yours, `upstream` is the one PRs are opened against. A
first run sees the `upstream` remote and writes `upstream/<its default branch>`
into `config.json` itself. If you add the remote later, set the two keys in
settings; naming the remote in `upstream_ref` is enough, since the other is
inferred from it.

Either way the base ref is one setting and both halves of it agree, which is what
`git::detect_base` and the reconciliation in `Config::parse` are for.

### The review queue

A queue ships, so the pane works on a fresh install: on first start the daemon
writes `reviews.js` into its config dir and points `reviews_command` at it. It
asks `gh` for open PRs in your repo where your review is requested, ranks them,
and prints the JSON in [`docs/reviews-json.md`](docs/reviews-json.md). Needs `gh`
authenticated; no npm install, it has no dependencies.

It is **ejected, not embedded** — three consequences worth knowing:

- **Edit it.** The ranking is one opinion (it guesses at `stopper` and `prio`
  labels). It is a normal file in your config dir; change it and the daemon leaves
  your version alone forever.
- **Delete it** to get the shipped version back. Absent is the only case the
  daemon writes, so removing the file is how you ask for a reset.
- **Replace it** by pointing `reviews_command` anywhere else — your own script, a
  `mise` task, whatever already knows your team's real ranking. Clear the setting
  entirely and the pane reads "not configured" rather than pretending.

The one contract is the JSON on stdout. A non-zero exit shows the pane as
*degraded* with the command's own stderr, deliberately distinct from "no reviews",
because silently showing an empty queue when the command is broken is the failure
that would actually cost a colleague a day.

### Filing stories in a tracker

With `tracker` set, a review point that is fair but out of scope can be filed as a
story and answered with its id, instead of a promise nobody is holding.

The tracker is reached **over MCP**, by an agent the daemon borrows for the value.
So two things have to be true beyond the token, and both live in the repo you
pointed the daemon at, not in its config:

- **`tracker` in `config.json` is three fields**, and one shape only:
  `{"mcp_server": "shortcut", "host": "app.shortcut.com", "token_env":
  "SHORTCUT_API_TOKEN"}`. Absent means no tracker, and a bare name is refused with
  the object to write. It is not settable from the settings pane, which shows it
  read-only: a per-site host is not a dropdown, and a partial write would replace
  what you hand-edited.
- **`.mcp.json` declares a server named for the tracker**, and `tracker.mcp_server`
  in the config is that name. The daemon approves that one server for the sessions
  it spawns — never all of them, since a repo may declare a dozen and a
  story-filing agent has business with none of the others. Remote or stdio makes no
  difference: it is a name in that file either way.
- **`tracker.token_env` is optional.** Name it and the daemon resolves the variable
  and pushes it into the agent's environment, so the token never reaches a prompt or
  a transcript. Leave it out and the MCP server authenticates itself — which is what
  the official Linear and Atlassian servers do, both being OAuth-first. Naming one
  is a preference: it is fewer logins.
- **A tracker skill** (`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) holds the team id, the workflow
  state, the story type and the epic routing. Those are yours and they change
  without this project changing, which is why they are not settings.

Get the first one wrong and Claude Code drops the server **silently** — the tool is
simply absent and the run burns its whole timeout mid-review. That is why the
daemon checks at boot and says so.

### The environment a session gets

A session gets the daemon's environment plus whatever `env_source` says the
session's own directory exports. That second half exists because the first is not
what you think it is: the daemon's environment is whatever started it, and started
from a desktop launcher that is the systemd user manager's, which holds no
checkout's variables at all.

It stays hidden because typing `claude` in that checkout still works: `mise
activate` exports at a shell prompt, and an app has no prompt. So anything that
expands a variable from the process environment — an `.mcp.json` header, a tool a
session shells — gets the empty string and fails in its own words rather than in
words about `PATH`.

So the daemon asks the tool directly, per spawn, in the session's own directory:
`mise env --json` or `direnv export json`. Two things worth knowing:

- **Every failure is silent by design.** No tool, no config, no trust, unreadable
  output: the session starts with what it had. A missing variable is a degraded
  session; a refused spawn is a lost one. An untrusted config is the one case that
  logs a warning, because the variables exist and the session is not getting them.
- **Trust is per config file.** mise refuses a `mise.toml` it has not been told to
  trust, and a worktree is a new path — so a fresh worktree can need `mise trust`
  before its sessions see anything. `worktree_setup` is the place to put that.

Set `env_source` to `none` if the daemon is already started with everything the
checkouts need.

### Worktree hooks

The daemon cuts and removes worktrees itself for PR worktrees, resumes and
relocated layouts. It runs your repo's own hooks around that.

**Creating.** Your repo's `WorktreeCreate` hook is asked first and the daemon
adopts the tree it printed, then puts that tree on the branch it needs; every way
that can decline falls through to the daemon cutting its own. Then these two run,
in order, with cwd set to the new worktree:

| Setting | For |
| --- | --- |
| `worktree_init` | the tree *as a checkout*: basing it on a fresh upstream, triangular push |
| `worktree_setup` | what it needs *beside* the code: symlinks back to main, generated config |

Both stand in for what your repo does at `WorktreeCreate`. Two rather than one so a
repo that splits that work points each setting straight at the script it already
has. Nothing here stands in for `SessionStart`, which fires for a daemon-cut tree by
itself, so whatever your repo hangs off that event still runs.

Both are non-fatal and the second runs even if the first failed: a tree that is
merely un-based is still worth linking. A relative script path resolves against the
main checkout, not the worktree, since the worktree may not carry it yet.

**Removing.** Teardown runs your repo's `WorktreeRemove` hooks, then `git worktree
remove` and `git worktree prune`, which no-op when the hook already did the job. A
refusal is reported as it stands: never `--force`, never a recursive delete, since
a worktree can hold symlinks back into main and following them destroys the main
checkout.

### Declaring a managed process

A managed process is a long-running command for the main checkout — a build
watcher, a container stack — with the output patterns that decide whether the rail
reads it as healthy or failing:

```json
"main_processes": [{
  "name": "watch",
  "command": ["npx", "ng", "build", "--watch"],
  "failure_patterns": ["Error:", "ERROR in", "error TS"],
  "ok_patterns": ["bundle generation complete"],
  "autostart": false
}]
```

`ok_patterns` is the part worth getting right: it is what *clears* a failure. A
watcher whose success line is missing from the list leaves the rail stuck on
`build failing` after you have already fixed the compile.

**`stop_command`, when the command is a client rather than the process.** Empty
for anything ordinary, where killing the pty kills the process. Set it where that
is not true:

```json
"command": ["docker", "compose", "exec", "-T", "assets", "pnpm", "run", "build-watch"],
"stop_command": ["docker", "compose", "exec", "-T", "assets", "pkill", "-f", "build-watch"]
```

`docker compose exec` runs the watcher **inside the container**, and docker does
not signal it when the exec client goes away — so every start stacks another one
up in there, with nothing reaping them. The stop command runs in the workspace's
directory, bounded, immediately *before* the pty is killed, on every path that
means stop: the drawer's close, a restart, and the daemon shutting down. A failure
is logged and the pty is killed anyway.

## Troubleshooting

- **Every session dies the instant it starts.** Claude Code's workspace trust has
  not been accepted for that checkout, so `claude` refuses. Accept it in the dialog
  once, per checkout.
- **It will not start: "Orchestrator is already running".** One instance at a time,
  held by a pid file in the config dir, because a second one would spawn sessions
  into the same worktrees and take over the hook settings. Close the running app.
- **The review pane reads *degraded*.** `reviews_command` exited non-zero and the
  pane is showing its stderr. Deliberately distinct from an empty queue, which is
  what "no reviews" looks like.
- **A setting does nothing.** An unknown key is ignored in silence. Check the
  spelling against the tables above.
- **It is not in Finder, Spotlight or your launcher.** A mise or tarball install
  writes its entry on first launch, so start it once from a terminal. If it is
  still missing, run `orchestrator-desktop --install-desktop-entry`, which says
  where it wrote.
- **Started from the launcher, it cannot find `gh`, `node` or `claude`.** The PR
  pane reports no credential, the review queue reads unavailable, and a session
  dies on spawn. An app started by Finder or a desktop entry does not inherit your
  shell's `PATH`: macOS hands it `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`, which holds
  neither Homebrew nor mise. The app asks your login shell for its `PATH` at
  startup and adopts it, so this should heal itself. If it does not, your `PATH` is
  probably set somewhere an interactive login shell does not read.
- **A session cannot see a variable your shell has.** The daemon's environment is
  not your shell's. `env_source` bridges that per spawn, and an untrusted
  `mise.toml` is the one case that logs a warning instead of degrading quietly. See
  [The environment a session gets](#the-environment-a-session-gets).

## How it works

- **One process.** `desktop/` is a [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) v2 shell around
  the daemon as a library: `orchd::start` binds a loopback port and the webview is
  pointed at it. No sidecar, no fixed port, nothing left running. The window is
  frameless and the web UI draws its own titlebar (real traffic lights on macOS);
  window controls go over the same authenticated HTTP as everything else, never
  Tauri IPC.
- **Sessions are the daemon's.** It spawns every one with `--session-id`, so its
  own id and Claude Code's are the same value and hook correlation needs no
  mapping. It never adopts a shell-started session — that exactness is the point.
- **Hooks drive the state.** Claude Code's hooks (`SessionStart`, `PostToolUse`,
  `Stop`, `SessionEnd`, …) POST to the daemon, which is how a row knows whether it
  is working or waiting. The daemon's hook settings *merge* with the repo's own,
  so your project hooks keep firing.
- **Worktrees.** The daemon makes the tree, at whatever layout your repo uses: it
  asks your repo's `WorktreeCreate` hook first and adopts what that hook made, cuts
  its own with `git worktree add` when the hook declines, then runs `worktree_init`
  and `worktree_setup`, then starts a session *in* the tree. It used to hand the cut
  to `claude --worktree` at Claude Code's own layout, which pinned that session into
  worktree isolation — and that pin refuses writes as well as git, so a scratch dir
  shared into the tree by symlink could not be written from either side of the link.
  The isolation the daemon needs instead is its own, on the agent's Bash, and it is
  git-only: see the push guard below. Teardown is a six-check preflight, then your
  repo's `WorktreeRemove` hooks, then `git worktree remove`. Never `rm -rf`, because
  a worktree is full of symlinks into main.
- **The review flow, and there are two.** The rail's `handle` button starts
  `/orchd:handle-review` in a pane: one agent in the PR's worktree, reading the
  threads, applying what is right, asking you about the rest, and drafting replies
  it posts only on an explicit go. That is the default because the other one is not
  finished. The other one is the overlay — triage reads the threads and proposes,
  per thread, a stance and whether code changes; you decide on cards; a run commits
  per thread and drafts a reply you see beside the real diff before the daemon posts
  it on its own credentials. It is the second review item in a PR row's menu.
  Resolving a thread stays your button either way, by design.
- **`fix-pr` is hand-triggered, never automatic.** The guards that protect the
  machine and the repo remain (authorship, one run per PR, a busy branch, the push
  guard below); the automatic trigger does not. It is a gate you read before starting, not one that trips
  while you look elsewhere.

The web UI is compiled into the binary with `include_str!`, so it can never drift
from the daemon serving it — and a change under `web/` needs a rebuild.

## Security

Bound to `127.0.0.1` only, with Origin/Host validation and a per-start token
required on the WebSocket and every mutating route. Hook endpoints are exempt from
the token, because a hook Claude Code spawns cannot easily carry a per-start one.
They are confined to their own prefix and a schema that can only ever update state.
GitHub **reads** resolve `ORCHD_GITHUB_TOKEN`, then a `0600` `github_token_file`,
then `gh auth token`, and read scopes are all they need. **Writes are the other
half**: a thread reply, a 👍 and a re-requested review shell `gh` and use gh's own
credential, whatever you set here. So a read-only token does not make the daemon
read-only, and the resolve flow wants `gh` signed in.

**The trust boundary is your user account, not the process.** Loopback keeps the
network out and the Origin check keeps other web pages out. But `GET /` returns
the page with the token substituted into it and is deliberately not gated, so any
process running as you can read the token and then hold everything — including the
pty attach, which means typing into a live agent's terminal. Do not run this on a
machine you share with people you do not trust.

That is a trade rather than an oversight: on a single-user machine a hostile local
process can already ptrace the daemon, and gating the page would break the token
discovery the tooling depends on. It is written down because the alternative is a
sentence that earns trust it has not got.

Agents get narrower credentials than the SPA does, and that part *is* enforced: a
session asks with `ORCH_ASK_TOKEN`, good for its own session's routes, and a triage
run posts with `ORCH_POST_TOKEN`, good for one route on one PR. Neither is the app
token — which matters because those are the runs that read other people's review
comments.

There is a `PreToolUse` guard on the agent's git (`orch guard push`) with three
rules: no lease-less `--force`, no push to the base branch, and no git aimed out of
the worktree the session works in. The third replaces the isolation
`claude --worktree` used to pin, and it is deliberately narrower — git only, never
your writes, because main's branch and its recorded occupant are what the daemon
needs protected and a shared scratch dir is not its business.

The third rule is a question rather than a wall: its refusal names `orch outside
<path>`, which puts "may this session run git there?" to you through the same ask
box every other question uses. A yes is remembered **for that folder and what is
under it**, for the rest of that session, so the next checkout is a question of its
own. Nothing persists it, so a restart asks again. Read all three as a
**mistake-catcher, not a control**: it sees `Bash` tool calls only, so `gh`, an MCP
git server, or a script the agent writes and then runs all go around it. It is there
because a fix-pr run force-pushes with nobody watching, and that is the mistake
worth catching — not because an agent could be prevented from pushing.

## Developing

```
mise install
npm install --prefix tools               # once per clone: check-web and shot need it
git config core.hooksPath .githooks      # once per clone
cargo test                               # the daemon
mise run check-web                       # type-check the SPA + its module graph
cargo run -p orchestrator-desktop        # the app, daemon embedded
mise run shot                            # screenshot the running app (drives Chrome)
mise run fixture                         # a throwaway PR to drive the review flow
```

`cargo run -p orchd -- --main /path/to/your/repo` runs the daemon headless on the
app's own config and prints a tokened URL. `mise run shot` drives Chrome while the
app runs in **WebKitGTK**, so it is good for layout and not the last word.

[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) has the traps, [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) what is open,
[`docs/assumptions.md`](docs/assumptions.md) what the daemon assumes and what breaks
when each is false, and [`docs/spec.md`](docs/spec.md) the requirements the `(§N)`
comments point at.

Releases are CalVer (`year.month.n`): bump `Cargo.toml`, `desktop/Cargo.toml`,
`desktop/tauri.conf.json` and `Cargo.lock`, then tag `v<version>`. The workflow
refuses a tag that disagrees with the crate version.

### Layout

```
src/
  lib.rs        wiring, the router, the pollers, startup recovery, SPA serving
  main.rs       the headless CLI over the library; desktop/ is the other caller
  config.rs     config file, defaults, Settings read/write, transcript slug
  firstrun.rs   the first-run page: merges config, detects a fork layout, restarts
  model.rs      Workspace / Session / Process, State, ArchiveState
  state.rs      the daemon's owned state, snapshots, reconcile, durable-store writes
  instance.rs   the one-daemon-at-a-time pid lock
  headroom.rs   the pre-spawn resource check every session goes through
  window.rs     Chrome, and the handle the desktop shell registers
  pty.rs        portable-pty host, and the scrollback ring every pty keeps
  proc.rs       run a child with a deadline, portably (no coreutils `timeout`)
  hooks.rs      hook receiver and the generated settings file
  spawn.rs      session / worktree / process spawning, and worktree_setup
  health.rs     a managed process's output → health
  diff.rs       numstat, hunk parsing, word-level LCS
  edit.rs       file read/write with containment and conflict detection
  git.rs        status parsing, refs, unpushed, worktree ops, the review writes
  review_commit.rs  which commit a batch's work may be folded into
  forge/        the Forge seam: trait + dispatch (mod.rs), agnostic model
                (model.rs), the GitHub impl (github.rs, github_write.rs)
  triage.rs     the triage run, and the gates a worktree must pass first
  proposal.rs   what triage proposes: Stance × Mode, positions, patches, stories
  post.rs       the review batch end to end
  patch.rs      applying and committing what you approved, with staleness checks
  skills.rs     the vendored skills in skills/, written out as the plugin dir
                every spawn is handed with --plugin-dir
  story.rs      filing a tracker story for a fair-but-out-of-scope point
  env_source.rs where a session's own variables come from: mise or direnv, asked per spawn
  reviews.rs    review queue: runs reviews_command, parses JSON, degraded states
  fix_pr.rs     automation state, the fix-pr guard table, a run's verdict
  update.rs     both upgrade bars: is Claude Code behind (via mise), and which
                mise tool installed *us*, so the app can upgrade itself
  worktree.rs   teardown preflight, archive, revive, removal
  store.rs      session record persistence, orphan reaping
  api.rs        HTTP surface and the origin/token guards      ws.rs  event stream + pty attach
  guard.rs      the git rules (push blast radius, worktree isolation), run by `orch guard push`
  machine.rs    what the daemon needs from the machine, warned about at boot
  timing.rs     per-start phase lines: exec counts, share of the time, slow git
  testutil.rs   the shared test fixtures (scratch dirs, an AppState, a Pr)
web/            the SPA (vanilla, xterm.js vendored) — one module graph under js/,
                booted by app.js; snapshot.d.ts is generated from the Rust structs
desktop/src/    the Tauri shell: main.rs (window, boot, splash), launcher.rs (the
                .desktop entry and the macOS .app bundle), login_path.rs (the
                login shell's PATH, adopted before the runtime exists)
```

## Licence

Copyright © 2026 Kars Barendrecht.

[AGPL-3.0-only](LICENSE). Use it, run it, change it. If you distribute it, or run
a modified version as a network service, the source has to go with it under the
same terms.

The network clause is not decoration here. In the desktop app it does nothing —
the daemon binds loopback and you are both the operator and the user, so the
obligation is to yourself. It has teeth in the **headless** mode, which binds a
port and prints a URL: point that at an interface your team can reach and it is a
network service, and this licence is what keeps a hosted variant open.

The vendored web assets are not ours: xterm.js, PrismJS and four font families,
all MIT or OFL-1.1. [`THIRD-PARTY.md`](THIRD-PARTY.md) lists each one with its
version and the notice its licence asks to travel with it.
