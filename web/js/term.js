  /* **No WebGL under WebKitGTK, and that is the whole of the rule.** Its WebGL

   * refit and dropping the addon on context loss both failed to fix it, so the
   * canvas goes and the DOM renderer draws real text, which cannot garble.
   *
   * Two engines get the fast path back:
   *
   * - **A browser tab** (`chrome === 'none'`), which is Chromium or Firefox.
   * - **macOS**, which is WKWebView and not WebKitGTK. The condition used to be
   *   `chrome` alone, so a Mac took the DOM renderer on the strength of a bug
   *   measured on Linux — and paid for it, because the DOM renderer's cost is
   *   visible cells times paint rate, a Retina panel composites four times the
   *   pixels, and Claude Code repaints its whole TUI frame per keystroke. That is
   *   the reported typing lag.
   *
   * **The macOS experiment was settled, and WKWebView does garble** (#8): on a
   * Retina Mac the agent pane's glyphs turn to noise, cell by cell, and the
   * trigger is a *second* terminal writing while the pane repaints — a drawer
   * shell running `git status` was enough. Worse than the WebKitGTK case, because
   * a scroll does not clean it up: the repaint comes from the same corrupted
   * atlas.
   *
   * **So macOS gets WebGL for the agent pane only.** That is the narrower of the
   * two fixes the report offered, and it is narrower in the direction that
   * matters: dropping `IS_MAC` outright would bring back the typing lag the flag
   * exists to avoid, on the very pane you type into. Keeping one live context per
   * window instead removes the trigger — a single terminal never garbled — and
   * `CLAUDE.md` already named "a context to the visible terminal only" as the
   * answer for a neighbouring case.
   *
   * A **browser tab keeps WebGL for every terminal**, deliberately: Chromium and
   * Firefox have no such fault, and a drawer shell streaming a build log is
   * exactly where the canvas earns its keep. The cost of the macOS rule is that
   * such a shell falls back to the DOM renderer there, which is the trade the
   * corruption forces.
   *
   * Not the *scrolling* complaint, which was the other suspect this was held
   * against: that turned out to be xterm damping sub-50px wheel deltas, measured
   * separately, and no renderer would have changed it. */
  /* **A see-through window costs the canvas, and that is a real trade.** xterm's
     WebGL renderer paints an opaque ground: `allowTransparency` reaches the DOM
     renderer and not that one, so on macOS — where the rule above keeps WebGL for
     the agent pane — the largest surface in a transparent window stayed solid
     while everything around it let light through. Which is the whole effect,
     missing from the pane you look at.
     So asking for transparency gives up what the macOS rule was buying: the
     typing-lag mitigation a Retina panel needs while Claude Code repaints its
     whole TUI per keystroke. That is the cost of the setting, and it is the
     honest way round — a transparency setting that visibly does not apply to the
     terminal is worse than one that says what it costs.
     A **browser tab keeps the canvas** whatever this says: there is nothing behind
     a tab to show through, so giving up WebGL there would be a cost with no
     effect at all. */

  /* **A slow trackpad drag scrolls an agent pane in jerks, and xterm's own wheel
   * maths is why.** With mouse reporting on — Claude Code sets `?1000h`,
   * `?1002h`, `?1003h`, `?1006h` and never leaves the normal screen — every
   * wheel event goes down the mouse-report path, and `consumeWheelEvent` does two
   * things to it:
   *
   *   `Math.abs(deltaY) < 50 && (r *= .3)`   — sub-50px events cut to 30%
   *   only whole lines pass; the rest is banked
   *
   * A mouse wheel reports line-mode deltas or pixel deltas over 100 and never
   * enters that branch. **A macOS trackpad reports small pixel deltas and always
   * does.** Measured against this same vendored build: at 1px per event, 5 of 300
   * reached the agent and 295 were dropped; the cliff sits exactly on the 50px
   * constant. A real slow drag has a 13px median, so every event of it is damped,
   * ~4.6 events per line moved. That is the pane sitting still and then jumping.
   *
   * The same path also sends exactly **one report per event** whatever the delta,
   * throwing away the line count it just computed — so a fast drag under-scrolls
   * per pixel of travel. Both defects are in the one place, so both are fixed
   * here: accumulate the real pixel deltas, undamped, and emit one report per
   * whole line.
   *
   * `scrollSensitivity` is not the fix and is worth naming as a dead end: it
   * multiplies *before* the threshold test and the test reads the raw `deltaY`,
   * so a value that cancels the damping for a trackpad makes a mouse three times
   * too fast.
   *
   * **Agent panes only**, the same rule Shift+Enter above follows and for the
   * same reason: this writes a mouse report in the SGR encoding, which is right
   * because the agent asked for `?1006h`, and would be wrong for some other
   * program that enabled reporting in the default encoding. A drawer shell keeps
   * xterm's own behaviour. Two more ways out, both deliberate: `deltaMode !== 0`
   * is a line- or page-mode device, which was never damped, and `shiftKey` is
   * xterm's documented escape to the scrollback — `consumeWheelEvent` returns 0
