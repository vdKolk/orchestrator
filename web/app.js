// Two layers, and which modifier a key wears says which one it is. A new binding
// belongs to one of them; there is no third to invent.
//
//   • bare keys  — the overlay that is open, and only while it is open (review
//     cards, diff files). Nothing bare is global, because bare keys reach the
//     terminal.
//   • the app modifier — **⌘ on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere** (`core.appMod`): new
//     worktree / session / shell (n, Shift+n, Shift+t), switch session (Tab /
//     Shift+Tab), jump to what needs you (Space), the diff (Shift+d), zoom
//     (= − 0), save (s). The platform comes from the daemon, which knows it at
//     compile time, not from a sniffed user agent.
//   • Escape is not a layer, it is one rule: dismiss the topmost thing —
//     legend, then menu, then settings, then the open overlay.
//
// There is deliberately **no Alt layer**. It held the vim-style motion (Alt+j/k
// sessions, Alt+m main, Alt+d diff) and was removed: every action it carried had
// a Ctrl spelling doing the same job, so it was a second vocabulary for one set
// of verbs. Do not reintroduce it to dodge a collision — pick Ctrl+Shift instead.
//
// Two properties of the Ctrl layer worth knowing before extending it:
//
//   * **This tension is Linux-only.** On macOS ⌘ never reaches the pty, so the
//     app layer there costs the terminal nothing and Ctrl stays entirely the
//     terminal's. Everything below is about the Ctrl spelling.
//   * Plain Ctrl+<letter> shadows the pty, so **default to `Ctrl+Shift+…`** — the
//     zone terminals leave alone, which is why copy/paste already live there. Take
//     a plain letter only when the idiom is worth the key it costs, and say what
//     the cost was: `Ctrl+n` is worth it (universal "new", costs readline's
//     next-history), `Ctrl+d` is not (the diff is `Ctrl+Shift+d`, because `Ctrl+d`
//     is EOF and still has to exit a shell). `Ctrl+n` and `Ctrl+Space` (NUL,
//     emacs set-mark) are the two that currently take something.
