// The sandbox an end-to-end flow runs in: a real repo, a real daemon, a fake
// agent, and nothing shared with the machine it runs on.
//
// Three things make this safe to run anywhere, and each of them is load-bearing:
//
//   * `ORCHD_CONFIG_DIR` relocates every piece of durable state — config,
//     `sessions.json`, `automation.json`, the hook settings, the instance lock.
//     So a fixture daemon does not fight the real one, and the one-daemon lock is
//     per-sandbox rather than per-machine.
//   * `HOME` is relocated too, which is normally the wrong thing to do: the real
//     `claude` reads its credentials from there. With a fake agent there are no
//     credentials to lose, and it is what keeps transcripts out of the user's
//     `~/.claude/projects`.
//   * `PATH` is prefixed with a shim directory, which is how the fake agent takes
//     the place of `claude` without the daemon knowing.
