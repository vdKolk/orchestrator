// Opening a worktree at Claude Code's own layout, which the daemon cuts too.
//
// `worktrees_subdir` left at `.claude/worktrees` used to change who created the
// tree: the daemon spawned `claude --worktree` from the main checkout and adopted
// whatever cwd `SessionStart` reported. It does not any more — `spawn_worktree_session`
// says why, and the short version is that arm pinned worktree isolation into the
// transcript, which refuses writes as well as git. So this flow pins the layout
// making no difference to who cuts, and the lock the old arm left behind being gone.
//
// It also drives the stale-lock retry, on a lock put there by hand: that is now the
// only way to reach it, and it is still reachable in the wild by a repo that locks
// its own trees.
