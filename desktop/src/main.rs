//! Orchestrator as a desktop application.
//!
//! This is a window and a lifecycle, nothing more. The daemon it shows runs in
//! this same process — `orchd::start` binds a loopback port and the webview is
//! pointed at it — so there is no sidecar to supervise, no port to agree on
//! ahead of time, and no second process to leave behind on a crash.
//!
//! Deliberately absent: Tauri commands. The page is served from
//! `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, which Tauri classifies as a *remote* origin, and
//! opening IPC to it means granting `http://127.0.0.1:*` — every port, any
//! page — the right to close the window. The UI already has an authenticated
//! channel to the daemon, so window control rides on that instead and this
//! crate exposes no IPC surface at all.

// No console window on Windows for a release build.
