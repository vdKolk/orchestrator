       with a throwaway bundle: `uname -m` came back `x86_64` and
       `sysctl.proc_translated` `1`.
       The damage is not the translation, it is what the children inherit: `git`
       is a universal binary, so it ran its x86_64 slice, called `xcrun` as
       x86_64, and failed to load an arm64-only `libxcrun.dylib`. Every git call
       in the daemon failed, so a checkout read as "not a git work tree" and the
       start aborted — from a Spotlight launch only, while the same binary run
       from a terminal was fine.
       `LSRequiresNativeExecution` looks like the key for this and does nothing
       here: measured, still x86_64. A *priority list* is what LaunchServices
       reads, and it is a list rather than `arm64` alone so an Intel Mac falls
       through to the slice it can run. -->
