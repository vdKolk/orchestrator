//! First-run logic: the recent-projects list and validating a chosen folder.
//!
//! The pure half of the first-boot flow — no window, no daemon, no Tauri — so it
//! runs and is tested like everything else. The desktop crate's bootstrap server
//! serves these over HTTP and adds the two things that need the app: the native
//! folder dialog and starting the daemon. Detection of a repo's settings (base
//! branch, GitHub repo, processes) is the review step and lands beside this later.
//!
//! Recents live in the config dir, so `ORCHD_CONFIG_DIR` relocates them with
//! everything else — which is what lets a test point the whole list at a temp dir.
