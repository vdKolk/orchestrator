           for an answer just given. (CLAUDE.md carries what the two cost.)

           Skipping is safe because boot's fetch is *unconditional* and awaited: by
           now it has either refreshed the ref or logged that it could not, and the

           ref still resolves". The worst this costs is a base one poll interval
           staler, in the case where fetching does not work anyway.

           The sweep half was already *usually* skipped by `AppState::sweeping`,
           which made the behaviour depend on which of the two finished first. Not
           doing it at all is the same outcome without the race; the lock stays for
