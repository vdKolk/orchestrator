       the decisions were a plan the daemon applied; the button that sends them is
       called `apply, push and post`, so asking again per thread is asking twice for
       one answer, and it stops a run that has nothing left to decide.

       one myself". Nothing else here is weakened — the ancestry refusal above is a
       safety check rather than a preference, and it still holds the reply and says
       why. The ask channel is untouched for what it is for: a run that hits a
       question only you can answer still asks it (`orch ask`, `/stuck`).

       back and moved the conversation — leaving a session in main whose branch had

       --worktree` would go on refusing every git command aimed anywhere but that
       original worktree — including the tree it has just been moved into.
       `store::clear_worktree_pin` has already released it by the time this is read:
       `spawn_session` calls it on resume whenever the pin disagrees with the cwd, and
       a relocation is a resume.

       So this says what happened and asks for nothing. It used to tell the agent to
       call `ExitWorktree` first, on the belief that the daemon could not clear the pin
       from outside. That belief was wrong — see `clear_worktree_pin`, measured against
       128 transcripts — and the instruction outlived it, with two costs. The tool
       answers "No-op: there is no active EnterWorktree session to exit", which is the
       truth and reads as a failure; and an agent that has just been told it is
       isolated, and then told it is not, concludes the relocation did not happen. One
       went looking for its work in the old worktree and started moving by hand what
       it thought had been left. Telling it not to call the tool is the point of naming
       the tool at all.

       What this must *not* do is over-correct into reassurance. A first draft said the
       files had come with it and there was nothing to move — and a real session then
       proved that wrong: it followed the branch it was recorded on while its own edits
       sat on another branch in the tree it left. The daemon knows which branch it
       moved; it does not know which branch the agent was editing. So this states the
       first and asks the agent to establish the second. */
