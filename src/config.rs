/// **`token_env` is optional, which is the fact the research turned up.** The

/// (`https://mcp.atlassian.com/v2/mcp`) servers are remote and OAuth-first; both

/// logins than an OAuth dance, which is why Shortcut is set up that way here even
/// though it offers OAuth too — and never a requirement.

           `workspace_for_path` matches hook paths against.

           That match is the reason. A `PostToolUse` path goes through
           `canonicalize` before it is attributed (`hooks.rs`, so a shared
           symlink lands in the right pane), and comparing a resolved path against

           workspace and quietly never reaches the changed-files pane. Only the
           `--main` argument was resolved before this, so a checkout named in
           `config.json` was not.

           Latent on Linux, where `$HOME` rarely contains a symlink, and much less
           so on macOS: `/tmp`, `/var` and therefore `$TMPDIR` are all symlinks
           into `/private`.

           Falling back to the value as written is deliberate — a path that does
           not resolve yet is `validate`'s complaint to make, with the checkout it
           actually names, not something this silently rewrites. */
