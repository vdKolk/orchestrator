//! The seam between the daemon and whatever window is showing it.
//!
//! The SPA is served over http on 127.0.0.1, which Tauri treats as a *remote*
//! origin: `window.__TAURI__` and the whole IPC bridge are gated behind a
//! capability that has to name the origin, port and all. Our port is decided at
//! bind time and can fall back to an ephemeral one, so that origin is not
//! knowable when the capability is compiled in.
//!
//! Rather than fight that, the SPA asks the daemon — same origin, same token,
//! same code path as every other button in the UI — and the daemon asks the
//! window through this trait. The desktop crate implements it against Tauri's
//! Rust window API; headless orchd leaves it unset and the routes 404, which is
//! exactly right for a browser tab that has no window to control.
